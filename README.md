# Project Description: Data Mart Development for Texture Tales

# Problem Statement:
Texture Tales, a leading retail company, aims to improve its analytical capabilities by creating a centralized data mart. The data mart will consolidate key business metrics, enabling more efficient and insightful analysis. The primary goal is to design and implement a data mart that includes essential data fields such as date, region, platform, segment, customer type, transactions, and sales.

# Approach:
Data Extraction:

Source:
Extracted data from various operational databases and external sources, including sales records, customer databases, and transaction logs.
Tools Used: MySQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization.
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handled Missing Values: Identified and managed missing data points through imputation or removal.

Normalization: 
Standardized data formats and values across different sources to ensure consistency.
Data Integration: Merged data from multiple sources based on common keys (e.g., date, customer ID) to create a cohesive dataset.
Data Mart Design:

Schema Design:
Designed a star schema for the data mart, with a fact table capturing transactions and sales metrics, and dimension tables for date, region, platform, segment, and customer type.
ETL Process: Developed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to populate the data mart, ensuring data is up-to-date and accurate.

Data Analysis:
Transactional Analysis: Analyzed the number of transactions and total sales across different dimensions (e.g., date, region).
Customer Segmentation: Examined sales and transaction patterns across various customer segments and types.

Platform Performance: 
Assessed sales performance across different sales platforms (e.g., online, in-store).
Visualization and Reporting:

Dashboards: 
Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key metrics and provide stakeholders with real-time insights.
Reports: Generated comprehensive reports summarizing sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.
Statistical Analysis:

Trend Analysis:
Identified sales trends over time, highlighting peak sales periods and seasonal variations.
Performance Metrics: Calculated key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average transaction value, sales growth rate, and customer lifetime value.

# Conclusion:
The implementation of the data mart for Texture Tales yielded significant benefits:

Centralized Data Access: 
Provided a single source of truth for sales and transaction data, enhancing data accessibility and reliability.

Enhanced Insights:
Enabled in-depth analysis of sales performance, customer segmentation, and regional trends, leading to more informed business decisions.

Improved Reporting: 
Streamlined the reporting process with interactive Power BI dashboards, offering real-time insights to stakeholders.
